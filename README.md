# ImmediateAncestry

This project finds immediate ancestors using an HMM by looking at the population frequencies of different populations at different SNPs.

This project requires a slightly modified form of the tmhmm package https://github.com/dansondergaard/tmhmm.py/tree/master/tmhmm. This modified form is not available online.
